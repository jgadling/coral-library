coral-library
=============

This is a rough cut of the former SDMAS coral library site.  It is based on the AIMS coral identification site (http://coral.aims.gov.au/), and free for use under the creative commons non-commercial licens.

This site is meant to be exported to flat files via wget rather than served up dynamically, but suit yourself.  There is a simple speciesedit.php that makes typo fixes easy, but it should be removed before making the root directory publicly available.
